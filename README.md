# ``xmage-vintage-cube``

*Magic Online Vintage Cube* for use with [XMage][1], as curated [here][2].

The latest version of the cube can be obtained [here](./cube.dck)
(December 23, 2020).

## Rationale

*Vintage Cube* on XMage:

 * is frequently not up-to-date (the most recent one is from July 2020 as of
   initializing this project);
 * includes improperly coded card images, which generally do not load correctly
   (Japanese promotional alternate-art Planeswalkers are especially guilty
   of this);
 * doesn't exude Vintage feel by utilizing recent reprints and promos.
